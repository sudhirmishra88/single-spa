## Local development -- all at once
It is preferred to only run one app at a time. But if you need to run them all locally, you can do so with the following instructions

```sh
# First terminal tab
cd root-html-file
npm install
npm start
```
```sh
# Second terminal tab
cd app1
npm install
npm start
```

```sh
# Third terminal tab
cd app2
npm install
npm start
```

```sh
# Fourth terminal tab
cd navbar
npm install
npm start
```

Now go to http://localhost:4200 in a browser. Note that you can change any of the ports for the projects by modifying the Import Map inside of
root-html-file/index.html.
